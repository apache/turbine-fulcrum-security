        Lists of todos and ideas for future versions.

          <ul>
           <li>
              Need to use the encryption component!
            </li>
           <li>
              Finish fleshing out the Adapters for Turbine.  Right now they are a pretty minimal implementation
              to validate that the Adapter concept would work.  Currently they only support moving objects from
              fulcrum to turbine.  Sending objects from Turbine back to Fulcrum is not supported.  Just needs some
              grunt work.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try and figure out how to get both NTLM authentication, as well as retrieving the password, or the groups
              directly to use with "Basic" security model.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upgrade to using Merlin for unit tests instead of ECM..  Also have demos showing using the security module
              in Merlin.
            </li>
