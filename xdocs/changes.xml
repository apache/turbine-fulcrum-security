        Changed BasicUser, BasicGroup, DynamicUser, DynamicGroup, DynamicRole,
        DynamicPermission, TurbineUser, TurbineGroup, TurbineRole and TurbinePermission to
        interfaces. Added default implementations for existing security services.

        DynamicUserImpl, DynamicGroupImpl, DynamicRoleImpl, DynamicPermissionImpl,
        TurbineUserImpl, TurbineGroupImpl, TurbineRoleImpl and TurbinePermissionImpl instead.
